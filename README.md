## AI-Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions. It uses machine learning techniques to identify unusual patterns and prevent financial fraud in real time.

## Features

- Transaction data analysis using AI
- Real-time fraud detection
- Visualizations for anomaly insights
- Easy integration with existing systems

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn 
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploration)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sureshbabu2006/EPBL-HACKATHON.git
cd EPBL-HACKATHON
##Install the required packages

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

> If requirements.txt doesn't exist yet, list your project dependencies manually like pandas, scikit-learn, etc.



2.Run the application or script

If you're running a Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook

Or
if you have a script or API:
python app.py

## Dataset

The dataset used is **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions - DataSet.csv**, which contains transaction records with features such as:

- `amount`: Transaction amount  
- `type`: Type of transaction (e.g., payment, transfer)  
- `oldbalanceOrg`: Original balance of sender  
- `newbalanceOrig`: New balance of sender  
- `oldbalanceDest`: Original balance of receiver  
- `newbalanceDest`: New balance of receiver  
- `isFraud`: Label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

##License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.

Let me know if youâ€™d like help creating the Jupyter Notebook or model training code for this dataset too!
